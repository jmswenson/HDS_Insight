All python was done using Python 2.7 and all R was done with 3.3.1.

This is all exploratory analysis with the intention to develop a generalizable approach to clustering flow cytometry data.

Much of the exploration which led to promising results was done in the following Jupyter Notebook: dimension-reduction-using-PCA__single-well-c03____has_t-SNE_code.ipynb, however this is a large Jupyter Notebook and read_csvs_tSNE_DBSCAN_save_output-blast-only.ipynb has all the essential code.

Finally, note that for many of the Jupyter Notebooks I tested different hyperparameters of functions and that "Minkowski distance" with the default settings is just "Euclidean distance". I use the two interchangeably.
